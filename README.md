# Ice-Station-Z-Backup-Tool
This is also a Save Manager to backup your Ice Station Z PC/Steam saves into a folder. It can also import/inject backup save data. In-Case you ever forget to exit without saving, Or you just died of dehydration while AFK while a day passed by.

Like normal. This application has to be inside the "Downloads" folder on the C:\ Disk.

*This Version of the Save Manager, marks the first time Quick Backups/Imports are a thing!*

*Known Bug: The Save Manager (the original version) cannot write while previous Backup files are inside the folder. Until this gets fixed I suggest making sub-folders for each backup inside of the "Backup-Saves" folder.*
