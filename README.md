May have broken the Installer file. If I did, just make a issue request if you encounter anything. ;) Thanks in advance.

These applications may trigger windows defender. (These are false positives). This is 100% the old application just updated to work with a better compiler.

Like normal. This application has to be inside the "Downloads" folder on the C:\ Disk.

The Installer Package Carries a special made version re-written from scratch. It should load faster, and I decided to allow backups to be moved into a import folder right after you backup you data. Will be adding it to where it just copies it to your Documents folder soon.
