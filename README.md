# Ice-Station-Z-Backup-Tool
A simple application to backup your Ice Station Z PC/Steam saves into a folder. It can also import/inject backup save data. Incase you ever need forgot to exit without saving. Also, this cannot be patched out with any update. So it can also be used for save glitching and getting all items back, if there is a patch in the future for it.
