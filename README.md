Like normal. This application has to be inside the "Downloads" folder on the C:\ Disk.

*Known Bug: The Save Manager (the original version) cannot write while previous Backup files are inside the folder. Until this gets fixed I suggest making sub-folders for each backup inside of the "Backup-Saves" folder.
